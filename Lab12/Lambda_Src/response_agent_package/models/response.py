Gen2X Security Engineering Platform

Module:
    response.py

Part I:
    Response Foundation Models

===============================================================================

Business Objective
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Response models describe recommended security actions.

A response begins only after evidence has been evaluated and a threat has
been identified.

The response layer answers three initial questions:

    1. Which response are we discussing?
    2. What system, identity, resource, or indicator would be affected?
    3. What action is being recommended?

Part I intentionally does NOT determine:

    • Whether the recommendation is approved
    • Whether execution is authorized
    • Whether the action has been performed
    • Whether the action succeeded
    • Whether the investigation is complete

Those responsibilities belong to later response and execution layers.

# Finding

#
# Eventually
#
# someone asks:
#
# "What should
# we do?"
#
# That question
#
# sounds simple.
#
# It isn't.
#
# Disable
#
# an account?
#
# Rotate
#
# a credential?
#
# Isolate
#
# a system?
#
# Block
#
# an endpoint?
#
# Remove
#
# a repository secret?
#
# Every action
#
# changes
#
# something
#
# in the real world.
#
# And changing
#
# the real world
#
# has consequences.
#
# A technically
#
# correct response
#
# performed
#
# against
#
# the wrong target
#
# is still
#
# a failure.
#
# A technically
#
# correct response
#
# performed
#
# without authority
#
# may become
#
# an incident
#
# of its own.
#
# So before
#
# automation
#
# reaches
#
# for the button...
#
# it should know
#
# three things:
#
# Which response
#
# are we discussing?
#
# What exactly
#
# would we change?
#
# And why
#
# do we believe
#
# that change
#
# should happen?
#
# Recommendation
#
# is not
#
# authorization.
#
# Recommendation
#
# is not
#
# execution.
#
# Recommendation
#
# is judgment
#
# waiting
#
# for governance.
#
# A good system
#
# knows
#
# what it recommends.
#
# A great system
#
# also knows
#
# that knowing
#
# what should
#
# be done
#
# does not

# permission

# Chewbacca's Commentary 🐾
#
# Investigations
#
# are journeys.
#
# Authorization
#
# is permission.
#
# They are not
#
# the same thing.
#
# An investigation
#
# may begin
#
# with one alert.
#
# Then another.
#
# Then evidence.
#
# Then conflicting
#
# evidence.
#
# Then someone says:
#
# "We understand
# what happened."
#
# And five minutes later
#
# someone else
#
# finds something new.
#
# Welcome
#
# to security.
#
# This is why
#
# investigations
#
# should not
#
# pretend
#
# to be
#
# perfectly linear.
#
# Humans investigate
#
# by learning.
#
# Learning
#
# changes
#
# understanding.
#
# Understanding
#
# changes
#
# decisions.
#
# But decisions
#
# create
#
# another question:
#
# "Who gave us
# permission
# to do this?"
#
# Knowing
#
# that an account
#
# should be disabled
#
# does not mean
#
# every engineer
#
# may disable it.
#
# Knowing
#
# that a workload
#
# should be isolated
#
# does not mean
#
# an autonomous agent
#
# should immediately
#
# pull the network cable.
#
# Good automation
#
# understands
#
# capability.
#
# Secure automation
#
# understands
#
# authority.
#
# Capability asks:
#
# "Can I?"
#
# Governance asks:
#
# "May I?"
#
# Mature engineering
#
# knows
#
# that these
#
# are profoundly
#
# different questions.
#
# And when
#
# the answer
#
# is uncertain...
#
# the correct action
#
# may simply be:
#
# wait
#
# for a human.
#
# That is not
#
# weak automation.
#
# That is
#
# automation
#
# that understands
#
# its place
#
# in a system
#
# built by
#
# and accountable
#
# to people.
