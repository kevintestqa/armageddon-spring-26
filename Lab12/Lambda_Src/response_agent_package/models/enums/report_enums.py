Gen2X Security Engineering Platform

Module:
    report_enums.py

===============================================================================

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module defines the enumerations used by the Gen2X Reporting Framework.

The reporting framework is responsible for communicating the results of
security analysis.

Reports do not perform threat analysis.

Reports do not collect intelligence.

Reports do not calculate risk.

Reports communicate conclusions that were produced elsewhere in the platform.

Examples include:

    • Threat Intelligence Reports
    • Executive Dashboards
    • Compliance Evidence Reports
    • Incident Summaries
    • SOAR Response Reports
    • Threat Hunt Reports
    • Vulnerability Assessments

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architectural Philosophy

Gen2X separates the investigation lifecycle into distinct responsibilities.

Indicators answer:

    "What did we observe?"

Providers answer:

    "What evidence did we collect?"

Threat Analysis answers:

    "What does the evidence mean?"

Reporting answers:

    "How should the conclusion be communicated?"

This separation allows one investigation to be presented in many formats
without recalculating or changing the underlying security assessment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The structured report remains the source of truth.

Renderers change presentation.

They do not change evidence.

===============================================================================

Chewbacca's Commentary 🐶

One investigation may produce:

    • A JSON document for another application

    • A PDF for leadership

    • Markdown for GitHub

    • HTML for a dashboard

    • Console output for CloudWatch

Every format should contain the same underlying facts.

Only the presentation changes.

Good software separates:

    Data

from

    Presentation

The report should never change the investigation.

It should only explain it.

#
# Recommendation priority is not the same as finding severity.
#
# Example:
#
# A critical vulnerability exists on a development server that will be
# destroyed tonight.
#
# Finding severity:
#
#     CRITICAL
#
# Recommendation priority:
#
#     LOW or MEDIUM
#
# Why?
#
# Context matters.
#
# Security engineering is not just assigning labels.
#
# It is understanding the environment around the finding.

# Architect's Reflection
# =============================================================================
#
# Notice how this file contains no:
#
#     • ReportLab
#     • boto3
#     • S3 logic
#     • Bedrock prompts
#     • PDF generation
#     • JSON serialization
#     • Threat scoring
#
# That is intentional.
#
# This module defines vocabulary.
#
# Builders construct reports.
#
# Renderers present reports.
#
# Storage components publish reports.
#
# Threat engines calculate conclusions.
#
# Each part of the framework has one responsibility.
#
# As the platform grows, this separation allows:
#
#     • New report formats
#     • New audiences
#     • New report types
#     • New renderers
#
# without rewriting the investigation engine.
#
# Framework architecture is often less about writing more code.
#
# It is about placing code where it belongs.
